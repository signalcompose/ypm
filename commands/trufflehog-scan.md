## Important Notes

### 1. Scan Time

- Scanning many projects may take time
- Maximum 30 second timeout per project

### 2. False Positives

TruffleHog performs pattern matching for secrets, which may produce false positives.
Always verify detected content.

### 3. History Scanning

TruffleHog scans entire Git history.
Even if current code has no secrets, past commits will be detected.

### 4. Privacy

Scan results include project names and paths.
Following YPM's "no external exposure of project info" policy,
DO NOT include these results in Git commits or PRs.

**Always display results to user after running this command.**
