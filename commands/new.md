description: "Launch project setup wizard (use /ypm:project-bootstrap instead)"

This command has been replaced by the `project-bootstrap` skill.

Use `/ypm:project-bootstrap` or say "create a new project".

The skill provides the same 8-phase interactive wizard with Progressive Disclosure for better context management.
