# YPM Configuration File (Template)
#
# Copy this file to create your config.yml:
#   cp config.example.yml config.yml
#
# Then edit config.yml to match your environment.

# Monitor target directories
monitor:
  # Directories to monitor (multiple allowed)
  # Examples:
  #   - /Users/yourname/Projects
  #   - /home/yourname/workspace
  #   - ~/Documents/dev
  directories:
    - /path/to/your/projects    # TODO: Change to your project directory

  # Exclusion patterns (e.g., this project itself)
  # Specify as relative path or partial match
  exclude:
    - proj_YPM/YPM         # Exclude YPM itself
    # Add more as needed:
    # - "node_modules"
    # - ".git"
    # - "tmp"

  # Project detection patterns
  # Directory patterns for detecting Git repositories
  # Adjust according to your directory structure
  #
  # Examples:
  #   - "*"              # 1 level (all projects directly under)
  #   - "work/*"         # 2 levels (work/project1, work/project2, ...)
  #   - "proj_*/*"       # Specific naming convention (proj_xxx/yyy)
  patterns:
    - "*"                # Default: all projects directly under
    # Add more as needed:
    # - "personal/*"
    # - "client/*"
    # - "work/*/*"       # 3 levels

# Project classification criteria
classification:
  # Active: updated within N days
  # Default: 7 days (1 week)
  # Adjust examples: 3 days (short), 14 days (2 weeks)
  active_days: 7

  # Dormant: no updates for N days or more
  # Default: 30 days (1 month)
  # Adjust examples: 60 days (2 months), 90 days (3 months)
  inactive_days: 30

# Progress estimation criteria
# YPM estimates progress from documentation and Git history
# Use these as reference; manual adjustment in PROJECT_STATUS.md is also possible
progress:
  phase_0: 0-20    # Design/planning stage (documentation, architecture design)
  phase_1: 20-30   # Development environment setup (dependencies, initial config)
  phase_2: 30-60   # Core feature implementation
  phase_3: 60-80   # Testing/improvement (bug fixes, refactoring)
  phase_4: 80-100  # Production/feature expansion (deployment, new features)

# Editor settings
editor:
  # Default editor for /open command
  # Supported: code (VS Code), cursor (Cursor), zed (Zed)
  # Change with: /open --editor <editor_name>
  default: code

# Other settings
settings:
  # Language setting for YPM command output
  # This controls the language of PROJECT_STATUS.md and other YPM-generated content
  #
  # Supported: en (English), ja (Japanese)
  # Default: en
  #
  # IMPORTANT: This is independent from Claude Code's response language
  # Three language settings work together:
  #   1. Claude Code response language (.claude/settings.json "language")
  #   2. YPM output language (this setting)
  #   3. Documentation language (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.)
  #
  # Example: You can have English CLAUDE.md, Japanese Claude responses,
  #          and Japanese YPM output by setting:
  #          - .claude/settings.json: "language": "japanese"
  #          - config.yml: language: ja
  #
  # When set to non-English, Claude will translate YPM output dynamically
  language: en

  # Include non-Git directories
  # false: Monitor only Git repositories (recommended)
  # true: Monitor all directories (Note: non-Git projects will also appear)
  include_non_git: false

  # Documentation loading priority
  # YPM retrieves project overview in this order
  # Adjust order as needed
  doc_priority:
    - CLAUDE.md      # Claude Code instructions
    - README.md      # Project overview
    - docs/INDEX.md  # Documentation index
