## Overview

YPM is a tool that automatically collects and organizes the status of multiple projects within a specified directory and displays them in a unified view.

**Who is this tool for?**
- Engineers and creators working on multiple projects simultaneously
- People with side projects alongside their main work
- Managers overseeing multiple team projects

### Problems It Solves

- ✅ Too many projects to track which ones are active
- ✅ Difficult to remember the status of side projects
- ✅ Time-consuming to check what needs to be done next
- ✅ Hard to visualize progress and priorities

---

## Features

- **Automatic Collection**: Gathers information from Git history and documentation
- **Centralized Management**: All projects managed in a single file
- **Claude Code Integration**: Easy updates using Claude Code
- **Progress Visualization**: Displays progress metrics for each project
- **Next Task Identification**: Shows what to do next for each project
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize monitoring targets via `config.yml`

---

## Prerequisites

- **Claude Code**: Required for running YPM
  - [Get Claude Code](https://claude.ai/download)
- **Git**: Used for collecting project information
- **Python 3.8+**: For project scanning (included in the plugin)

---

## Installation

YPM is installed as a Claude Code plugin, making it accessible from **any directory**.

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

```bash
# In Claude Code, first add the marketplace:
/plugin marketplace add signalcompose/claude-tools

# Then install the plugin:
/plugin install ypm@signalcompose/claude-tools

# Or use the Discover tab in /plugin menu
```

### Step 2: Initial Setup

```bash
# Run the setup wizard (from any directory)
/ypm:setup
```

The setup wizard will interactively collect:
1. Path to the project directories to monitor
2. Project detection patterns
3. Classification threshold days for active/inactive status

Upon completion, `~/.ypm/config.yml` will be automatically generated.

### Step 3: First Scan

```bash
# Scan your projects
/ypm:update
```

This will generate `~/.ypm/PROJECT_STATUS.md` with all project information collected.

### Data Location

YPM stores all user data in `~/.ypm/`:

```
~/.ypm/
  ├── config.yml           # Your monitoring settings
  └── PROJECT_STATUS.md    # Generated project status
```

This separation ensures:
- Plugin updates don't affect your configuration
- Easy backup (just backup `~/.ypm/`)
- Works across all your projects

---

## Usage

### 1. Check Project Status

```bash
# View the status file directly
cat ~/.ypm/PROJECT_STATUS.md

# Or use the command
/ypm:active
```

View the status of all projects at a glance.

### 2. Update Status

```bash
# From any directory in Claude Code
/ypm:update
```

This will automatically:
1. Scan directories specified in `~/.ypm/config.yml`
2. Retrieve Git information for each project
3. Read documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs/INDEX.md)
4. Update `~/.ypm/PROJECT_STATUS.md`

### 3. Check Next Tasks

```bash
/ypm:next
```

Displays next tasks for each project in priority order.

---

### New Project Setup Command

#### `/ypm:new`
Launches an interactive wizard to help set up new projects.

Sets up projects step-by-step through 8 phases:
1. **Project Planning**: Requirements definition, technology selection
2. **Directory Creation**: Local directory creation and Git initialization
3. **Documentation Setup**: Development environment based on DDD/TDD/DRY principles
4. **GitHub Integration**: Remote repository creation and initial push
5. **Git Workflow Setup**: Branch strategy and rule establishment
6. **Environment Configuration**: `.gitignore`, `.claude/settings.json`
7. **Documentation Management Rules**: Synchronization between implementation and documentation
8. **Final Confirmation**: Ready to start development

**After setup completion**:
- Move to the new project directory
- Start development in a dedicated Claude Code session for that project
- YPM will automatically add it to monitoring targets on the next `/ypm:update`

See [project-bootstrap-prompt.md](../project-bootstrap-prompt.md) for details.

### Git Workflow Command

#### `/ypm:setup-gitflow`
Set up Git Flow workflow for the current project with branch protection and security settings.

**What it does**:
- Creates `main` (default) and `develop` branches
- Configures branch protection (no direct push to main/develop)
- Disables squash/rebase merge (merge commit only)
- Sets up security settings based on project type (CODEOWNERS, Secret Scanning)

**Project Types**:
1. **Personal Project** - Minimal settings, solo development
2. **Small OSS** - CODEOWNERS, branch protection recommended
3. **Large OSS** - All security settings enabled

**Usage**:
```bash
/ypm:setup-gitflow
```

The command will interactively ask about project type and development style to configure appropriate settings.

### Security & Export Commands

## Progress Calculation Criteria

YPM estimates project progress based on the following criteria:

| Progress | Phase | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 0-20% | Phase 0 | Design/Planning |
| 20-30% | Phase 1 | Development Environment Setup |
| 30-60% | Phase 2-3 | Basic Feature Implementation |
| 60-80% | Phase 4-5 | Testing/Improvement |
| 80-100% | Phase 6+ | Production/Feature Expansion |

**Note**: These are estimated values. Manually adjust if they don't match reality.

---

## Customization

Edit `~/.ypm/config.yml` to customize YPM behavior.

### Language Settings

YPM implements a **three-level language configuration** system. These settings are independent and work together:

#### 1. Claude Code Response Language

Controls what language Claude uses when responding to you.

**Location**: `.claude/settings.json` (user setting, not in repository)

```json
{
  "language": "japanese"
}
```

This setting ensures Claude responds in your preferred language, even when reading English documentation.

#### 2. YPM Command Output Language

Controls the language of YPM-generated content (PROJECT_STATUS.md, etc.).

**Location**: `~/.ypm/config.yml`

```yaml
settings:
  language: en   # Options: en (English), ja (Japanese)
```

- **English (`en`)**: Default, output displayed as-is
- **Japanese (`ja`)**: Claude dynamically translates YPM output to Japanese

#### 3. Documentation Language

The language of project instructions and documentation (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.).

For YPM itself:
- **Public docs**: English (README.md, guide-en.md, commands)
- **Internal dev docs**: Japanese (docs/development/, docs/research/)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: These three settings are COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT**
>
> - Changing `.claude/settings.json` does **NOT** affect `~/.ypm/config.yml`
> - Changing `~/.ypm/config.yml` does **NOT** affect Claude's response language
> - You must configure **EACH setting separately** to achieve your desired setup
>
> They work together but are controlled independently.

#### Example Configuration

You can have English CLAUDE.md with Japanese responses and Japanese YPM output:

```
.claude/settings.json:  "language": "japanese"  → Claude responds in Japanese
~/.ypm/config.yml:      language: ja            → YPM output in Japanese
CLAUDE.md:              Written in English      → Instructions for Claude
```

**Why English CLAUDE.md?**
- Avoids UTF-8/CJK character crashes (known Rust bug)
- Leverages Claude's better English training
- Recommended by Japanese Claude Code community
- Japanese responses are guaranteed by `language` setting

The language setting is applied during `/ypm:setup` when you select your preferred language, or you can change it manually in the config file.

### Adding Monitoring Targets

Add to `directories` in `~/.ypm/config.yml`:

```yaml
monitor:
  directories:
    - /Users/yamato/Src
    - /Users/yamato/Work      # Add
    - /Users/yamato/Projects  # Add
```

### Changing Project Detection Patterns

For different directory structures:

```yaml
monitor:
  patterns:
    - "proj_*/*"          # 2-level structure
    - "projects/*"        # 1-level structure
    - "my-apps/*/src"     # 3-level structure
```

### Changing Default Editor

Set your preferred editor in `~/.ypm/config.yml`:

```yaml
editor:
  default: cursor    # Change from code to cursor
  # Options: code (VS Code), cursor (Cursor), zed (Zed), terminal (Terminal.app)
```

Or use the command:
```
/ypm:open --editor cursor
```

### Changing Classification Criteria

Modify active/inactive threshold days:

```yaml
classification:
  active_days: 14    # Change to 2 weeks for active
  inactive_days: 60  # Change to 2 months for inactive
```

---

## Update Frequency

- **Recommended**: Once a week
- **Minimum**: Once a month

Regular updates help you stay on top of project status.

## FAQ

### Q: How do I add a new project?

**A**: Create a project under the directory specified in `~/.ypm/config.yml`, and it will be automatically detected on the next `/ypm:update`.

### Q: How do I exclude a project?

**A**: Add to `exclude` in `~/.ypm/config.yml`:

```yaml
monitor:
  exclude:
    - proj_YPM/YPM
    - old_projects/*   # Pattern to exclude
```

### Q: Progress percentages are inaccurate

**A**: Manually edit `~/.ypm/PROJECT_STATUS.md` to adjust them.

### Q: Next tasks are not displayed

**A**: Add development plans to the project's `CLAUDE.md` or `docs/`. YPM will read and display them.

### Q: Can I use this on another machine?

**A**: Yes. First add the marketplace with `/plugin marketplace add signalcompose/claude-tools`, then install with `/plugin install ypm@signalcompose/claude-tools`, and run `/ypm:setup` to configure your environment. You can also copy your `~/.ypm/config.yml` to the new machine.

## Future Enhancements

YPM is currently at **Phase 1 completion**. The Claude Code-driven approach has proven effective in production use.

Potential future enhancements:

- [ ] Project creation support tool
- [ ] Dashboard UI (web-based)
- [ ] Slack notification integration
- [ ] Automatic priority calculation
- [ ] Gantt chart generation
- [ ] Inter-project dependency visualization

**Note**: Automated update scripts (cron support) are currently deprioritized, as AI-based contextual understanding and flexible task extraction are superior.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Project not detected

**A**: Check the following:
1. Is it a Git repository? (Does `.git/` directory exist?)
2. Does the directory structure match the configured pattern in `~/.ypm/config.yml`?
3. Is it included in the exclusion list?

### Q: "config.yml not found" error

**A**: Run `/ypm:setup` to create the initial configuration file at `~/.ypm/config.yml`.
